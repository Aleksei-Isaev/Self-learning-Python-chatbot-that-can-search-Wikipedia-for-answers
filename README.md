# Self-learning Python chatbot that can search Wikipedia for answers

I have long wanted to make my own Jarvis. I recently had a free minute and I did it. He knows how to correspond with you, as well as look up answers to your questions in Wikipedia.

## Setting up

Python 3 must be already installed!

Clone this repo, and in the directory follow these steps:

```shell
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
pip install Wikipedia
pip install scikit-learn
```
